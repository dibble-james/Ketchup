Currently distubuted under the MIT license.

###Contribution
Raising issues for bugs is encouraged whenever and whoever you are.  If you would like to contribute to the project please [email me](mailto:james@jdibble.co.uk) and I will add you as a contributor.  Core projects are all Stylecopped and eventually will be Code Analysed.  Unit test coverage should always be 100% in the `Ketchup.Core` and `Ketchup.Model` namespaces.

###Documentation
Is in the pipeline.  The Samples projects should be a good start.
